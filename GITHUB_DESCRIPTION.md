## Full Description (for README or repository about section)

**Production-Grade Web Application Firewall (WAF) Lab**

A high-performance, modular Web Application Firewall built with Python `aiohttp` for asynchronous request processing. Designed for cybersecurity education, lab environments, and WAF architecture research.

### 🎯 Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns (config, logger, inspector, router, core, utils, metrics)
- **Security Models**: Negative Security Model (NSM) with pattern matching + Positive Security Model (PSM) support
- **Anomaly Scoring**: Behavioral analysis with weighted threat indicators
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm with IP-based throttling
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Web-based traffic monitoring with live attack visualization
- **Observability**: Structured JSON logging (ELK/Loki), Prometheus metrics, PRTG integration
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, and more
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 32/32 tests passing, pytest-based test suite
- **Docker Ready**: Multi-stage builds, health checks, production-hardened

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+
- aiohttp (async HTTP framework)
- Prometheus client
- Docker & Docker Compose

### ⚠️ Educational Use

This project is designed for learning WAF architecture and cybersecurity concepts. Not recommended for production use without comprehensive security audit and hardening.

### 📚 Use Cases

- Learning WAF architecture and design patterns
- Cybersecurity lab environments
- Reverse proxy security testing
- Security research and development
- PRTG/Prometheus monitoring integration
- OWASP Top 10 mitigation techniques
